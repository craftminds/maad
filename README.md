# maad

Maad is Modbus as a database project.

## Getting Started

The main idea of the application is to:
- read Modbus device
- save data in form of database table

The registers can be grouped and stored in tables for ease of later use. This is the introduction to test the onyl library for Modbus that exist in the flutter environment and try to contribute to develop it futher (ie. continue the serial connection)

- [ ] create prototype of the application using basic flutter library
